# How to Generate vendor/autoload.php for Development Server

The error you're encountering is because the `vendor/autoload.php` file is missing. This file is automatically generated when you install the Composer dependencies for your Laravel project.

## Steps to Generate vendor/autoload.php

1. Make sure you have Composer installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the root directory of your project (where the `composer.json` file is located).

3. Run the following command to install all dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

This will:
- Read the requirements from your `composer.json` file
- Download all required packages
- Generate the `vendor` directory with all dependencies
- Create the autoload files including `vendor/autoload.php`

4. After the installation completes, you should be able to run your development server without any issues:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

## Alternative Approaches

If you're using Laravel Sail (Docker-based development environment):

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail up
```

If you're trying to use the script defined in composer.json:

```bash
composer run dev
```

The `vendor/autoload.php` file is essential for any PHP project using Composer as it handles the autoloading of all classes from installed dependencies.
